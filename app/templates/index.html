                    <h3>Leaving Highschool</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was advised to pursue TL-HAVO from primary school, but I chose the easier path. I never had the motivation to put in my best effort at school. Although I completed all requirements satisfactorily, my performance in secondary school was not exceptional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After secondary school, I initially chose to study ICT at ROC Mondriaan Tinwerf. My grades were generally quite decent, but my attendance and motivation in this program were also lacking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In reality, I did not want to pursue further education and preferred to start working as a painter. However, my father insisted that I complete at least a minimum level of education before leaving school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since I became a painter, I chose an <a href="{{ url_for('main.coming_soon') }}" class="timeline-link">MBO Level 2 program</a>. I successfully completed this program and even achieved a perfect score of 10/10 on the mathematics examination.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div> 
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-img"></div>
                <div class="timeline-content fadeInRight">
                    <h3>Working as a Painter</h3>
                    <p>
                        I then started working as a house painter, a profession I pursued for approximately ten years with great enjoyment, and which I still occasionally practice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, software development continued to intrigue me. I attempted to teach myself the <a href="{{ url_for('main.coming_soon') }}" class="timeline-link">Python programming language</a>, but I was quickly overwhelmed by the vast amount of information required to write even a simple program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was only one option left for me: returning to school. This time, I chose to enroll in the Software Developer program at <a href="{{ url_for('main.coming_soon') }}" class="timeline-link">mboRijnland in Leiden</a>.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>   
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-img"></div>
                <div class="timeline-content fadeInRight">
                    <h3>Switching to Software Developer</h3>
                    <p>
                        This time, I began the program with a tremendous amount of motivation, which paid off on multiple occasions. I was repeatedly asked to take on <a href="{{ url_for('main.coming_soon') }}" class="timeline-link">extra projects such as supervising an exchange program</a> and was even given the opportunity to <a href="{{ url_for('main.coming_soon') }}" class="timeline-link">mentor HBO students</a> as a challenge provider for their project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The results of my motivation are also reflected in my grades. I <a href="{{ url_for('main.coming_soon') }}" class="timeline-link">graduated</a> cum laude as the top student in the Software Development program at mboRijnland. I should note that seven years ago ROC Leiden transitioned into mboRijnland, but it is still an achievement I am extremely proud of!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, I participated in an <a href="{{ url_for('main.coming_soon') }}" class="timeline-link">AI research project</a> for which I received a certificate of excellence. This research focused on how schools can responsibly handle the use of AI. I conducted various studies for this project and delivered multiple presentations together with a team of students and a teacher.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        School provided me with a solid foundation to build upon. By paying close attention and completing my assignments diligently, I am now able to write code independently and solve problems reasonably well.

                                Battlebot was my final internship at mboRijnland within the Technology department. My task, together with a fellow student, was to fully automate the existing robot.

                    <h3>Future Toughts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Given my age and the other steps I wish to take in life, I am currently unable to continue formal studies, although I would have very much liked to do so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, I am highly motivated to further expand my knowledge, building on the strong foundation that school has provided me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For now, I am considering focusing on mastering a programming language thoroughly, while simultaneously continuing to study computer theory in general.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the <a href="{{ url_for('main.coming_soon') }}" class="timeline-link">Battlebot internship</a>, we worked with bit operators and hexadecimal values. I find this aspect of computing extremely interesting and would like to learn more about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the near future, I plan to study a low-level programming language in order to gain practical experience in this area.
